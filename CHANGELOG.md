# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.0)

### Improvements

### API Changes

* The `BaseView.contentView` property of was removed because it no longer had any functionality in the framework.

    This is a minor backwards incompatible change. If you've copied one of the included nib files from a previous release, you may get a key-value coding runtime error related to contentView, in which case you can subclass the view and add a `contentView` property or you can remove the outlet connection in Interface Builder.

## [1.0.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.2)

### Improvements

* Remove the `iconContainer` property from `MessageView`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix constraints generated by `BaseView.installContentView()`.

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.2)

### Feature

* Add support for specifying an `IconStyle` in the `MessageView.configureTheme()` convenience function.

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.1)

* Add code comments.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.0)

* Initial release.
